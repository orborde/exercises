The warden of the prison will show you a chessboard with a coin in
every square. The coins will be randomly heads or tails. The warden
will pick one square on the board, and then allow you to flip up to
one coin. Then you will leave and your cellmate will come in. Your
cellmate must look at the board and choose the square that the warden
chose.
