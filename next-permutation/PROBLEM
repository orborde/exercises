Write a function that, given an array of integers, returns the
next-highest permutation of that array. "Next-highest" is defined as
the next in the list of possible permutations of that integer set,
sorted in ascending order.

For example, f([1,3,2]) = [2,1,3].

Note that there may be duplicates in the array.
